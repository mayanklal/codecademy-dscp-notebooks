    "* **Literals** - Match exact set of literals. The regex `monkey` will completely match the text `monkey` but will also match `monkey` in text `The monkeys like to eat bananas`.\n",
    "* **Fixed Quantifiers** - Denoted by a `{}`. Matches exact quantity or the quantity range of characters to be matched. The regular expression `roa{3}r` will match the text `roaaar`, while the regular expression `roa{3,6}r` will match `roaaar`, `roaaaar`, `roaaaaar`, or `roaaaaaar`.\n",

    "* **Wildcards** - Denoted by a `.`. Can match any single character. the regular expression `.........` will match the text orangutan, marsupial, or any other 9-character text.\n",
    "* **Kleene** - `*` indicates that the preceding character can occur 0 or more times.  `+` indicates that the preceding character can occur 1 or more times.\n",
    "* **Grouping** - Accomplished by open `(` and close parenthesis `)`. Thus the regular expression `I love (baboons|gorillas)` will match the text `I love baboons` as well as `I love gorillas`, as the grouping limits the reach of the `|` to the text within the parentheses."
